The CqlGenerator Interface provides an Interface for generation Cql given a URI or String input for the Vmr/Drools data and the output for the location of the generated Cql and Elm Libraries.  There is an Operation that is wired up at GenerateCQLFromDroolOperation.java  it takes an output path, encoding, fhirversion, input path, and the type for the granularity of the cql you want either from the Condition level or the ConditionRel level.  CqlTypes.java has the two options there.
The CqlGenerator was built with that interface in order to allow for Transformations from other data representations not just Drools / Vmr.  And you will see that consistently throughout this project.  Everything is Abstracted and separated in order to allow for different Modeling and Logic representations.  So the the DroolCqlGenerator takes those paths or URI's and deserialized the Conditions.  Then it sets up the VmrToModelElmBuilder sets up the traverser with the proper visitor builds the libraries with the context.  As of right now it writes out the libraries in the method, but this should really be pulled out and put into the Operation or something like that.  Everything is built up in the ElmContext, so you should be able to grab the Cql Libraries and the Elm Libraries from the resulting ElmContext.
